  fodf_path: result/csd # You can specify a path containing the gold standard / ground-truth fODFs, which can be used for supervised training of the model. Here, we assume that every subject would have a folder with the csd output root/subject_1/result/csd.
  data_path_validation: root/val_split # Give either the path of a subject folder, i.e. root/subject_1, or the path of a folder with a list_subjects.txt file. These subjects will be used for validation.

  normalize_per_shell: False # Pre-processing normalization of the response functions and diffusion signal. If set to True, then the signal is normalized shell-wise (each shell is normalized by a shell-specific value), otherwise each shell is normalized by the B0 value. Recommended setting is False.
  normalize_in_mask: False # Pre-processing normalization of the response functions and diffusion signal. If set to True, then each subject is normalized by the average diffusion signal in the provided brain mask, otherwise it is normalized by the provided WM response function. Recommanded setting is False.
